A solver for word ladder puzzles.

File with a list of English words required for the program
was downloaded from http://thinkpython2.com/code/words.txt.

As the author of Think Python says, this list was "collected and contributed
to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the Moby lexicon project [...].
It is a list of 113,809 official crosswords; that is,
words that are considered valid in crossword puzzles and other word games".

Building each graph for the first time may take several seconds.
Further reuse with reading graphs data from a file, where it have been stored,
makes execution almost instant.

graphs.pkl file contains a serialized python dictionary of some the most useful
word graphs (for the lists of 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-letter words).

Warning from the official Python site: "The pickle module is not secure 
against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Never unpickle data received
from an untrusted or unauthenticated source".
